Bywaf Developer documentation
=============================

Bywaf is a command-line tool for streamlining web application firewall
auditing. It consists of a command-line interpreter and a set of
plugins. This document describes the Bywaf application's architecture,
the API it provides for plugins and the requirements for writing
plugins.

Architectural overview
----------------------

The Bywaf application is built on Python's built-in cmd.Cmd class. Cmd
is a lightweight command interpreter loop that provides several useful
facilities for the developer, including overridable hook methods and
easy addition of commands and help.  For the user, it offers
commandline editing with readline, including automatic tab completion
of commands, command options and filenames.

Bywaf contains a sub-classed version of Cmd called Wafterpreter, which
adds some important additions, including:

   - Loading and selecting plugins
   - Getting and setting global and per-plugin options
   - Additional methods exposing functionality to the plugins
   - Backgrounding jobs, ending running jobs and querying job status
   - Loading scripts from the the command-line or within the interpreter   
   - Loading, saving, showing and clearing the command history

Wafterpreter employs a simple plugin system consisting of python
modules containing commands exposed to the user (functions starting
with "do_") and a dictionary of user-modifiable options ("options").

A number of Wafterpreter methods have been exposed to plugins,
allowing them to change the interpreter's behavior and access other
modules' options.

For notifications of changes in plugin options, Bywaf supports
callback functions.  The Wafterpreter will call a function for a given
plugin option if it begins with "set_"; for example, for an option
like "FILENAME", the Wafterpreter will search for and call a
set_FILENAME(), if it exists.  The Wafterpreter will also search for
and call "set_default()", if it exists, for any option that does not
have a specific setter function.  Failing these attempts, Wafterpreter
will perform a direct assignment on the plugin's option. 


Overriden Cmd methods
---------------------

In order to accommodate the extra functionality required by Bywaf,
Wafterpreter overrides the following Cmd methods:

  - onecmd(): executes a user command.  Overriden to add job
    backgrounding functionality.
  - postcmd(): called on completion of a user command.  Overridden to
    notify user of completed jobs.
  - postloop(): called on exit from the command loop.  Overridden to
    display a farewell message.
  - emptyline(): called on empty input lines. The default
    Cmd.emptyline() returns True, causing Cmd.commandloop() to exit.
    Overridden to return nothing. 
  - getnames(): Overridden to return list of instance properties
    ("self") rather than class properties ("self.__class__"), thus
    including dynamically-added command functions.
  - completenames(): overridden to add a space to first-level
    completion of commands.


Built-in Wafterpreter commands
------------------------------

Internal commands take the form of callback methods defined in the
Wafterpreter's class definition, or as callback functions defined in a
plugin module.  When a command is entered at the command-line,
Wafterpreter searches for a corresponding method or loaded plugin
module function whose name begins with "do_" and ends with the command
name.

The following native commands are available in Wafterpreter:

  - do_use(): select a module.
  
  - do_kill(): kills a running command. 
    commands in the job queue.
    
  - do_d(): removes a completed command from the job queue.

  - do_result(): displays the return result of a completed command.

  - do_script(): executes a script given a filename.  A script is a
    list of commands, one per line.  Among other things, this is useful
    for loading a configuration.  
    
  - do_gshow(): shows global options.  
  
  - do_set(): when a plugin is loaded, do_set() shows its options and
    functions available to the user.
    
  - do_show(): shows the currently-selected plugin's options and
    commands available to the user. 
    
  - do_shell(): executes a command in a system shell.  
    
  - do_history(): shows, clears, loads and saves the command history.
    
  - complete_ functions: Commands may have a corresponding
    tab-completion function.  This gets called after a user types the
    command name and hits the tab key.  complete_ functions are
    expected to return a list of matching completions to the 
    command-line string.  
    
    A utility method named "filename_completer()" is available for
    completing filenames on POSIX-compliant systems.

  - help_ functions: Commands may have a corresponding help function,
    prefixed with "help_".  This is called when the user issues "help"
    on that command.  It is expected to return a string with help
    documentation.  If a corresponding help_ function does not exist,
    then help documentation will be taken from the command's
    docstring. 


Wafterpreter API and utility methods
------------------------------------

The Wafterpreter API encompasses methods used by both the plugins as
well as the Wafterpreter's own methods; this allows for plugins to
refining its behavior by assigning their own methods in their place.
Utility methods are time-saving shortcuts; while the API methods are
the preferred way to change the interpreter's behavior and to perform
queries for jobs.  

  - filename_completer(): a utility method and API that when given a set
    of starting and ending indices of the current word under the
    command-line cursor, returns the available filenames the word
    matches.  This parameters to this method are supplied to
    completion methods, which can in turn pass them to this method.
  - get_job(): this utility method retrieves a Futures instace from the
    Wafterpreter's internal list of completed and running jobs, given
    its job ID.  This is useful in querying information about
    individual jobs (see do_kill() for an example). 
   - finished_job_callback(): This overridable method is called upon the
    completion of a backgrounded job.  It is used by the onecmd()
    method to notify the user when a backgrounded job has finished.
  - set_prompt(): an API method for setting the prompt to reflect a
    new plugin name.
  - get_history_item(): an API method returning the command history
  - save_history(): an API method for saving the command history to a file
  - load_history(): an API method for loading the command history from a file
  - clear_history(): an API method for clearing the command history
  - _load_module(): a private low-level method for loading modules.
    Gets called by do_use().  There should not be a reason for
    its use outside that method. 


Plugin requirements
-------------------

A plugin is a module containing an optional dictionary of options and
zero or more command functions (i.e. functions whose names start with
"do_").  It it is loaded when the user types "use <plugin-name>", where
<plugin-name> is the filename of a plugin's Python module.  

The "use" command calls Wafterpreter's do_use() to load the plugin.  
This method physically loads the module with load_module(), adds the
module to Wafterpreter's list of loaded plugins, and changes the
prompt to reflect the newly selected plugin. Additionally, it provides
the plugin with a link back to the Wafterpreter instance assigning
"self" to a new module property named "app".

A plugin's path is made availabe upon loading in the plugin's .plugin_path property.


What your plugin needs to define:
---------------------------------

As stated above, there is no requirement for a a plugin's module to
define anything.  There are instances where a plugin does not take any
options, and there are instances where a plugin may not offer any user
commands.  

For modules offering or requiring options, Wafterpreter expects them
to define an options dictionary in a specific format: they must take
the form:

  options = {
    option_name: (name, value, default_value, required, description) 
  }
  
where:

  - "option_name" is a string containing the option's name, 
  - "value" is a string containing the option's current value,
  - "default_value" is a string containing the option's default value,
  - "required" is a string of "Yes" or "No" describing whether or not this
    option must be set, and 
  - "description" is a one-line description of the option.  

A plugin module's functions will automatically be exposed as commands
to the user if their names start with "do_".  These functions may be
complemented with help_ and complete_ functions, just as do_ methods
in the Wafterpreter's class definition may be complemented with
complete_ and help_ methods. 

An example plugin definition appears in test.py.
